# Validation record

Local validation against the pinned source, recorded September 13, 2026.

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: passed.
- `cargo test --workspace`: 16 tests passed (14 core, 2 C ABI).
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`: passed.
- `cargo check -p anny-wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`: passed.
- Full-model Python-reference parity: **23/23 passed**, absolute tolerance 1e-6, relative tolerance 0. Integer arrays and labels are exact.
- Prepared Safetensors model -> native reload -> reference comparison: passed.
- Real C executable calling ABI 1 generated 13,718 vertices / 27,420 faces from imported assets.
- Native two-iteration fitting smoke completed on real default-mesh data; resulting mean vertex error 0.0082489114 m. This is a functional smoke, not optimizer trajectory parity or a convergence benchmark.
- Native calibrated sampling read the original distributions and generated valid parameters from seed 42.

The default full-model vertex maximum absolute difference was 6.34847731784e-10 m.
Exact ordering comparisons included packed skinning indices, not just equivalent dense weights.

Reference environment: Python 3.13.5, PyTorch 2.10.0+cpu, RoMa 1.6.1,
Warp 1.9.1, Rust 1.90.0. All reference inputs were serialized explicitly.

Machine-readable results are in [validation.json](validation.json). To rerun,
use `tools/export_reference.py --cases all-cases` in the original Python Anny
environment, then `tools/check_parity.py`. The lightweight fixture runner fails
on missing inputs and does not regenerate reference answers with the Rust code.

Not verified here: actual browser execution/performance, real licensed SMPL or
SMPL-X assets, GPU implementations, exhaustive collision equivalence, or complete
iterative optimizer equivalence. CI separately checks Windows/macOS builds and
the C# example; a checked-in validation record does not assert future CI results.
